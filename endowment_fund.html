              <p>The role of higher education in National development is well established. Higher Education in India has expanded very rapidly in the last five decades after Independence and has emerged probably as one of the largest education systems in the world.</p>
              <p>With the rapid expansion of knowledge and the unprecedented scientific and technological progress, the universities / Institutions are finding it difficult to keep pace with the changing need of society due to the inadequacy of financial resources. </p>
              <p>The University Grants commission while formulating the guidelines of incentives for resource mobilization for X-Plan stressed the need of support from the public, in realizing the goals of higher education. Further the Ministry of Human Resource Development (F.No.33-4/2020-TS-III (Pt.1), dt 5th May 2020), Govt. of India, has directed the CFTIs to create the ‘Endowment fund’ for the purpose of mobilizing donations and contributions from alumni, Industry and Philanthropy.</p>

                            <p>In the recent past several such <span class="bold">GIVE BACK </span>initiatives were planned and Alumni batches have created corpus to the tune of over Rs. 1 crore. </p>
                            <p> Several Alumni have also donated bulk amounts with a focused objective like Innovation, Design thinking and Tinkering etc.</p>
                            <p> The underlying theme and notable feature of all such initiatives is that Alumni do have and feel great affinity akin to filial bonds of children towards their parents, and were conveying a deep Fund strong urge to do some significant, unique and substantial service in all possible ways and means, by working in tandem and association with NITW and play a supplementary and even a complementary role in the promotion of studies, research and development in the fields of science, engineering and technology, including futuristic studies as also nascent and emerging technologies (like Nano technology, cloud computing, Big Data, VLSI, Renewable Energy, ITS and new branches of science like life sciences etc.,) and create necessary infrastructure and organizational setup.</p>
                            <p>In addition to these initiatives, several corporates are willing to support academic institutions by setting up Centers of Excellence with substantial funding from their CSR grants. Such initiatives have also larger perspective of not limiting the benefits of such support to our institute, but in turn spread and share these facilities for the improvement of technical education in the region.</p>

                            <p>The institute has some of the best talent pool of technocrats and researchers who are young and are willing to explore uncharted areas and challenges. In order to meet the aspirations and requirements of such researchers, funding from within institute budget may not suffice. In such circumstances, departments or individual faculty can float a project proposal for funding with clear details of objectives, achievable deliverables and value addition to curriculum or to the institute. Such project proposals can be vetted by the NITW Endowment Fund management committee (hereafter referred as <span class="bold">“COMMITTEE”</span>) and floated to alumni and corporates seeking support and funding. The support can be either in the form of funding or executing a project in BOT mode. </p>
                            <p>Thus, broadly the category of financial contributions can be in the following forms:</p>
